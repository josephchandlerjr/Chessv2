# Chess version 2

This is the second version of my chess game. Still a lot of legacy code from 
version 1 which started as a console game but we're getting there. This
version uses the MVC design pattern to make things cleaner and more extensible.
I intended this to be the end of this program to move on to other 
learning opportunities but I doubt my OCD will allow me to that so expect this 
code to be revised and extended upon in the future.
